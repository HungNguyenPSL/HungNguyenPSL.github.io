## PhD Research — Knowledge Graphs and Large Language Models

As a **CIFRE PhD student** at **IP Paris × Nokia Bell Labs**, I am conducting research on **combining Knowledge Graphs and Large Language Models (LLMs)** to improve the **reliability**, **interpretability**, and **factual grounding** of AI-generated content.  

My research is supervised by:
- **Prof. Mehwish Alam** (Institut Polytechnique de Paris)  
- **Dr. Alonso Silva** (Nokia Bell Labs)  
- **Dr. Liubov Tupikina** (Nokia Bell Labs)  

The goal of this work is to design **neuro-symbolic systems** that can reason over structured knowledge while maintaining the expressivity and flexibility of LLMs.  
I am particularly interested in **structured generation**, **knowledge injection**, and **alignment between textual and graph-based representations** for more reliable AI applications.

## One-Step Retrosynthesis Modeling

During my Master’s research, I developed **Transformer-based** and **metric learning** models to predict chemical reactions from products to reactants.  
By integrating **few-shot learning** and **subclass mapping**, the model achieved strong predictive accuracy and fast inference.

**Keywords:** Deep Learning, Metric Learning, Retrosynthesis, Transformers
