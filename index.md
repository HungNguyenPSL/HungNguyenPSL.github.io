## About Me

I am a **CIFRE PhD student** at **Institut Polytechnique de Paris** and **Nokia Bell Labs**, conducting research on **combining Knowledge Graphs and Large Language Models (LLMs)** to improve the **reliability** and **factual grounding** of AI-generated content.  

My work is supervised by [**Prof. Mehwish Alam**](https://sites.google.com/view/mehwish-alam/home), [**Dr. Alonso Silva**](https://www.nokia.com/people/alonso-silva/), and [**Dr. Liubov Tupikina**](https://www.nokia.com/people/liubov-tupikina/).

My research focuses on **structured generation**, **symbolic reasoning**, and **neuro-symbolic integration**, bridging **structured knowledge** and **neural representations** for more **interpretable and trustworthy AI systems**.

Previously, I earned my [**Master’s in Mathematics and Machine Learning (IASD - Mathematics Track)**](https://www.masteriasd.eu/en/) from **PSL University (University Paris Dauphine × ENS PSL)** with *High Honors*.
