## About Me

I am a **CIFRE PhD student** at **Institut Polytechnique de Paris** and **Nokia Bell Labs**, conducting research on **combining Knowledge Graphs and Large Language Models (LLMs)** to enhance the **reliability** and **factual grounding** of AI-generated content.  
My work is supervised by **Prof. Mehwish Alam**, **Dr. Alonso Silva**, and **Dr. Liubov Tupikina**.

My research focuses on **structured generation**, **symbolic reasoning**, and **neuro-symbolic integration**, aiming to bridge **structured knowledge** and **neural representations** for more **interpretable and trustworthy** AI systems.

Previously, I earned my **Master’s in Mathematics and Machine Learning (IASD - Mathematics Track)** from **PSL University (University Paris Dauphine × ENS PSL)** with *High Honors*.
