# About Me

I am a **CIFRE PhD student** jointly affiliated with **Institut Polytechnique de Paris** and **Nokia Bell Labs**, working under the supervision of **Prof. Mehwish Alam**, **Dr. Alonso Silva**, and **Dr. Liubov Tupikina**.

My PhD research focuses on **integrating Knowledge Graphs and Large Language Models (LLMs)** to improve the **reliability** and **factual grounding** of AI-generated content.  
This work aims to create **structured, interpretable, and knowledge-aware AI systems** that can reason over symbolic information while maintaining the generative power of neural models.

I am particularly interested in **structured generation**, **knowledge-informed reasoning**, and **neuro-symbolic architectures** for trustworthy AI.

Prior to my PhD, I completed my **Masterâ€™s in Mathematics and Machine Learning (IASD - Mathematics Track)** at **PSL University**, where I developed **metric learning** and **Transformer-based** models for retrosynthesis prediction under **Prof. Tristan Cazenave**.

My long-term goal is to advance the **integration of symbolic and neural paradigms** to design AI systems that are both **powerful and interpretable**.
